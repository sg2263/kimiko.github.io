							<h2>History</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Michael Kimiko was born on June 21st, 2003, into a Bengali family in Kolkata, West Bengal, India (2). From a young age, she displayed academic excellence and a sociable nature, earning her the admiration of those around her.

								Kimiko's fascination with true crime began during her time in fifth grade, where she found herself drawn to subjects involving gore, brutality, and slashing. Despite concerns raised by those around her, she remained undeterred and pursued her leisurely interest.</p>
							

							<p id="hidden-paragraph" style="display: none;">
								In 2012, Kimiko achieved a significant milestone when her first journal about true crime was published in the Times of India on May 19th, 2012. However, due to the grotesquely horrific nature of the content, which went beyond what was typically covered by mainstream media, the journal faced major criticism and was subsequently pulled down. Despite this setback, Kimiko's determination remained unshaken, and she continued her studies and work on subsequent journals.

By presenting her story in a more informative and engaging manner, we can highlight Michael Kimiko's journey as a true crime expert and emphasize her dedication to exploring the dark realms of serial killers and behavioral theories.</p>
